# Dilatation_of_time
Graphical simulation to understand the dilatation of time

When you will launch the programm, you will see two black lines. The upper one is the proper time of a static person and the lower one is the proper time of a moving person. As long as you set speed (with the slider at the bottom of the window), the lower line seems to stretch out.
I made this little simulation to have a visual effect of how the speed influence the proper time. But you have to keep in mind that time is relative. The clock of the moving person seems rotate slower from the point of view of the static person.

This programm has been created in february 2019.
